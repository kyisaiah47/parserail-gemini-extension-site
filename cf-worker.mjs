// Worker entry. parserail-gemini-extension is now a page on ParseRail, so every path on this host answers 308 with
// the matching ParseRail page and keeps the query string: the crawl files go to the same file on
// ParseRail's host, and every other path, static assets included, goes to /docs/gemini-extension, the page for
// parserail-gemini-extension. assets.run_worker_first in wrangler.jsonc sends asset paths through this handler too.
// The Next app is still built and its Durable Object classes are still exported, the same shape
// as the ShipProbe redirect repos. Nothing else is exported: the Workers runtime reads every named
// export as an entrypoint and refuses a constant.
